### project description
We analyzed the statistics of shootings in New York over the past 20 years. We used data collected from various sources to examine the main characteristics of shooting incidents, as well as to identify possible trends and patterns.

### data sources
- [Shooting Incident Data from 2006 (NYC Open Data)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8)
- [List of hospitals (NYC Open Data)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Hospitals/833h-xwsx)

### what did we do?
1. Data parsing 
2. Calculation of the distance to the nearest hospital for each incident
3. EDA (exploratory data analysis)
4. Visualization and search for patterns

7. Training ML model to predict shooting mortality based on the parameters of the incident
